MQTT Logger Grapher is a client side software for logging MQTT topics from a broker to a SQLite3 datavbae, and displaying the data with Highcharts in a web browser. Designed specifically to monitor power inverter data from SolPipLog, but can be used for any MQTT data. The web interface is responsive, so it's suitable for desktop or mobile devices.
